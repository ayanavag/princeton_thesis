This repository includes all of the R scripts that I used for my undergraduate senior thesis. 
I was a part of Dr. Daniel Notterman's lab of the Molecular Biology Dept. at Princeton University. 
My thesis is titled: "Methylation Signals of Early Atherosclerosis in At-Risk Children and Young Adults: A Multi-Omic Analysis of the Future of Families Cardiovascular Study"
